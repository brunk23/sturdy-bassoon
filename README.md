We are going to make a javascript version of the classic
stone takeaway game. We start with a pile that has a random
number of stones in it.  We can remove any number up to a given
amount. For example, we might be able to remove 1, 2, 3, 4, or
5 of the stones at any turn.

The player who takes the last stone (or stones) wins.
